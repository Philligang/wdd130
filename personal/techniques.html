            <h2 class="sub-title">Shadows</h2>
            <p>Shadows can be difficult to incorporate in your mini, there is a simple yet important technique that allows for shadows to naturally form where they should on the miniature. if you ask yourself where shadows should form, you would come to the conclusion that they should form in cracks and crevices, or perhaps in the folds of clothing or armour. Instead of worrying about adding shadows after your primary paint job, the simple solution is to add a basecoat. In order for the shadows to show up best, i recommend adding a basecoat of black or a darker grey to whatever mini you're painting, and it allows you to be a little less meticulous while layering and shadows will naturally begin to pop up on the miniature.</p>

            <h2>Drybrushing</h2>
            <p>Drybrushing is an important technique to pick up, as it allows you to add a layer of a different color while leaving the previous color in any cracks or crevices. Drybrushing effectively can be a little annoying as a beginner as you feel like you aren't making much progress, but once you see the results you'll come to realize it's worth it. (You may want to use an older brush) When drybrushing you want to remove the majority of your paint from your brush, and once there is hardly any remaining you can start to paint the layer you're on. You will notice that while you are leaving paint behind that the crevices are nearly untouched.</p>
