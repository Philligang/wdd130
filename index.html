        <p> Hey there, I'm Jake. I am currently studying CIT and I'm mostly looking to explore my options with this field. </p>
        <p>I've been married to my wife Grace for just under a year and a half, and the two of us like to try new things, recently we've been cooking together.</p> 
        <p>I love DND and I paint and sell miniatures for the hobby. I don't have alot of time these days, but I love to watch movies or read to decompress.</p>
